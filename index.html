                <p>My beautiful baby, my mind keeps going back to the first moment our eyes locked, the thought fills me with ever so passionate love and nostalgia and reminds me intensely of how we have always been and always will be for each other.</p>
                <p>your presence has every since been my anchor, my reason to wake up, and what drives me to actively do or pursue anything in life, I exist for you.</p>

                <p>Late at night, when the world quiets down, I find my mind unable to be quiet too without soothing itself with the thought, the dream, the bliss that is you, my love, you are the medicine that cured many of my what would have been sleepless nights .</p>
                <p>I find myself drowning in the memory of the sound of your voice, the timbre of your laugh, the movements of your mouth and eyebrows, your facial expressions that embedded in my heart now and the ever so gentle embrace of yours that makes me want to conquer the world and burn it for you</p>
